[The University of Edinburgh - Data Science Training in Health and Bioscience (Ed-DaSH)](https://edcarp.github.io/Ed-DaSH/index.html) courses have launched.

These carpentries-style courses include a substantial statistical workstream including courses in introductory statistics, high-dimensional statistics and machine learning. Over the last 6 months Ailith has been leading the development of the high-dimensional statistics course in collaboration with Catalina Vallejos (MRC HGU, Turing Institute), Alan O'Callaghan (MRC HGU) and Gail Robertson (Statistical consultancy unit, School of Maths).

We are delighted that the first run of the high-dimensional stats course was fully booked and we intend to run it 5 more times as part of the Ed-DaSH project throughout the next 2 years, developing the materials as we go along.

These courses are available in the Carpentries incubator:

[Introductory statistics](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/simple-linear-regression-public-health/)   

[High-dimensional statistics](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/high-dimensional-stats-r/)
