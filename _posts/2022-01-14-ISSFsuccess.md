We're delighted to have been awarded a Wellcome-University of Edinburgh ISSF3 award! 

Wellcome's Institutional Strategic Support Fund (ISSF) is intended to support institutional strategies for the biomedical sciences, with up to Â£1.75M available to award each academic year. 

This award will fund the generation of some vital preliminary data that will enable us to model spatiotemporal evolutionary trajectories of mutation in high grade serous ovarian cancer in collaboration with Prof Charlie Gourley and Prof Simon Herrington.
