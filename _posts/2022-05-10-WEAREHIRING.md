<b>Are you excited to develop and apply statistical and computational methods to disentangle the structural variant landscape in tumours?</b>
</p>

We are looking for an enthusiastic and highly motivated quantitative scientist, interested in applying their expertise to studying cancer genomics and evolution using cutting edge, data-driven approaches. The overall goal is to model the spatiotemporal evolutionary trajectories of structural variants in tumours to inform patient stratification, better predict treatment response and improve clinical outcome for patients.
 
This is an excellent opportunity to undertake world-class interdisciplinary science driven by clinically important questions. You will play a critical role in the statistical analyses of large cancer sequencing datasets and will be embedded in a cross-disciplinary team at the Institute of Genetics and Cancer, working collaboratively with clinicians, biologists, and other computational scientists. The position is available for 2 years, with a start date as soon as possible.
 
This position would suit <b>EITHER</b>:
<p align="center">
A skilled quantitative scientist with a research background in any of maths, statistics, physics, computer science (or related disciplines) <br>AND who is motivated to learn how to apply their skills to biomedical questions
<br>
OR
<br>
A computational biologist with experience analysing high-throughput genomic data, particularly from tumours.
 </p>
Please drop me an email (Dr Ailith Ewing (Ailith.Ewing@ed.ac.uk)) with any informal enquiries.

Closing date 7th June 2022 5pm.
