            <p>Kitty is a first year PhD student in Prof. Ian Tomlinson’s lab at the Cancer Research UK
            Edinburgh Centre in the Institute of Genetics and Cancer at the University of Edinburgh.</p>
            <p>Kitty graduated from the University of Bristol with a degree in Biology in 2018 (upper-second
            class with honours), and then achieved distinction in MSc in Bioinformatics at the University
            of Birmingham. She then moved to Edinburgh in 2019 to begin working as a Scientific Officer
            in Cancer Genetics and Evolution in the Tomlinson group for 2 years before beginning her
            PhD.</p>
            <p>Kitty’s work focuses on genetic susceptibility to primarily colorectal cancer and incorporates
            computational analyses with wet lab work. Her PhD aims to discover novel germline and
            somatic driver genes and to increase our understanding on the role that different DNA repair
            pathways have on cancer risk.</p>
