I'm delighted to have been awarded an inaugural IGC Langmuir Talent Development fellowship and am immensely grateful to Hugh and Josseline Langmuir for the generous philanthropic donation that made these awards possible. 

This is an excellent opportunity at a tricky point in my research career and will hugely benefit my career progression. As a recently appointed cross-disciplinary Chancellorâ€™s Fellow at the Institute of Genetics and Cancer, I am in the process of starting my own research group to develop and apply statistical and computational approaches to analyse large cancer datasets to learn about tumour biology and explore ways of translating our discoveries into the clinic through collaboration with our clinical partners in the CRUK Scotland Centre.

This award will act as a springboard allowing us the financial breathing space to generate the vital preliminary data necessary to demonstrate in future funding applications the merits and feasibility of this line of research. It will provide the resources to allow us to focus on putting our ideas into practice which I expect in the course of the fellowship will reveal exciting insights into tumour biology and help establish the research identity of our group.

Congratulations also to the other recipients of these inaugural fellowships: my talented colleagues Dr Ava Khamseh and Dr Robb Hollis.
