Dr Stuart Brown passed his viva with minor corrections! 

His thesis titled:
<br>
<h4><center>'Genomic catastrophes: Complex Structural Variants in High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer'</center></h4>
<br>
investigates the prevalence, co-occurrence, distribution, and impact of multiple complex structural variant types on survival in high grade serous ovarian cancer and provides novel insights into the genomic diversity of high grade serous ovarian cancer.

Stuart is now working as a postdoc in Prof Bass Hassan's research group at the University of Oxford, applying his skills to study the genomics of sarcoma.

Congratulations Stuart!
