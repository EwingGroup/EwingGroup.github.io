&lt;p&gt;Kitty’s paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39248-0&quot;&gt;‘Germline de novo mutations in families with Mendelian cancer syndromes caused by defects in DNA repair’&lt;/a&gt; is now out in Nature Communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DNA repair defects underlie many cancer syndromes. We tested whether de novo germline mutations (DNMs) are increased in families with germline defects in polymerase proofreading or base excision repair. A parent with a single germline POLE or POLD1 mutation, or biallelic MUTYH mutations, had 3-4 fold increased DNMs over sex-matched controls. POLE had the largest effect. The DNMs carried mutational signatures of the appropriate DNA repair deficiency. No DNM increase occurred in offspring of MUTYH heterozygous parents. Parental DNA repair defects caused about 20–150 DNMs per child, additional to the ~60 found in controls, but almost all extra DNMs occurred in non-coding regions. No increase in post-zygotic mutations was detected, excepting a child with bi-allelic MUTYH mutations who was excluded from the main analysis; she had received chemotherapy and may have undergone oligoclonal haematopoiesis. Inherited DNA repair defects associated with base pair-level mutations increase DNMs, but phenotypic consequences appear unlikely.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to have been awarded an inaugural IGC Langmuir Talent Development fellowship and am immensely grateful to Hugh and Josseline Langmuir for the generous philanthropic donation that made these awards possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent opportunity at a tricky point in my research career and will hugely benefit my career progression. As a recently appointed cross-disciplinary Chancellor’s Fellow at the Institute of Genetics and Cancer, I am in the process of starting my own research group to develop and apply statistical and computational approaches to analyse large cancer datasets to learn about tumour biology and explore ways of translating our discoveries into the clinic through collaboration with our clinical partners in the CRUK Scotland Centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This award will act as a springboard allowing us the financial breathing space to generate the vital preliminary data necessary to demonstrate in future funding applications the merits and feasibility of this line of research. It will provide the resources to allow us to focus on putting our ideas into practice which I expect in the course of the fellowship will reveal exciting insights into tumour biology and help establish the research identity of our group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations also to the other recipients of these inaugural fellowships: my talented colleagues Dr Ava Khamseh and Dr Robb Hollis.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/path.5901&quot;&gt; Unravelling the tumour genome: The evolutionary and clinical impacts of structural variants in tumourigenesis &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
Structural variants (SVs) represent a major source of aberration in tumour genomes. Given the diversity in the size and type of SVs present in tumours, the accurate detection and interpretation of SVs in tumours is challenging. New classes of complex structural events in tumours are discovered frequently, and the definitions of the genomic consequences of complex events are constantly being refined. Detailed analyses of short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from large tumour cohorts facilitate the interrogation of SVs at orders of magnitude greater scale and depth. However, the inherent technical limitations of short-read WGS prevent us from accurately detecting and investigating the impact of all the SVs present in tumours. The expanded use of long-read WGS will be critical for improving the accuracy of SV detection, and in fully resolving complex SV events, both of which are crucial for determining the impact of SVs on tumour progression and clinical outcome. Despite the present limitations, we demonstrate that SVs play an important role in tumourigenesis. In particular, SVs contribute significantly to late-stage tumour development and to intratumoural heterogeneity. The evolutionary trajectories of SVs represent a window into the clonal dynamics in tumours, a comprehensive understanding of which will be vital for influencing patient outcomes in the future. Recent findings have highlighted many clinical applications of SVs in cancer, from early detection to biomarkers for treatment response and prognosis. As the methods to detect and interpret SVs improve, elucidating the full breadth of the complex SV landscape and determining how these events modulate tumour evolution will improve our understanding of cancer biology and our ability to capitalise on the utility of SVs in the clinical management of cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ailith</name></author><category term="launches" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome Jo Mattocks to the group!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/launches/2022/04/01/WelcomeJo.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome Jo Mattocks to the group!" /><published>2022-04-01T09:27:48+01:00</published><updated>2022-04-01T09:27:48+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/launches/2022/04/01/WelcomeJo</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/launches/2022/04/01/WelcomeJo.html">&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
