We have posted a [new preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.12.575376v1) on bioRxiv 'Divergent trajectories to structural diversity impact patient survival in high grade serous ovarian cancer'.

This work highlights high grade serous ovarian carcinoma as an exemplar tumour type for studying chromosomal instability and is the result of a combined effort across the Scottish High Grade Serous Ovarian Consortium to comprehensively characterise the mutational landscape driving high grade serous ovarian cancer.

I have highlighted our main findings in a [tweetorial](https://x.com/Ailith_Ewing/status/1747291048206901394?s=20).

<h4> Abstract </h4>

Deciphering the structural variation across tumour genomes is crucial to determine the
events driving tumour progression and better understand tumour adaptation and evolution.
High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is an exemplar tumour type showing extreme,
but poorly characterised structural diversity. We comprehensively describe the mutational
landscape driving HGSOC, exploiting a large (N=324), deeply whole genome sequenced
dataset. We reveal two divergent evolutionary trajectories, affecting patient survival and
involving differing genomic environments. One involves homologous recombination repair
deficiency (HRD) while the other is dominated by whole genome duplication (WGD) with
frequent chromothripsis, breakage-fusion-bridges and extra-chromosomal DNA. These
trajectories contribute to structural variation hotspots, containing novel candidate driver
genes with significantly altered expression. While structural variation predominantly drives
tumorigenesis, we also find high mtDNA mutation loads associated with shorter patient
survival, and acting in combination with alterations in the nuclear genome to impact
prognosis and suggesting new strategies for patient stratification.
