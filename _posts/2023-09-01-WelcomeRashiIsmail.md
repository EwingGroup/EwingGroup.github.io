We are delighted to welcome <b>[Rashi Krishna](/Rashi)</b> and <b>[İsmail Özkaraca](/Ismail)</b> to the group.

Rashi is a PhD student co-supervised with Prof Val Brunton and aims to identify drug response biomarkers in uterine leiomyosarcoma. We are excited to have Rashi in the group as she delves into computational cancer genomics alongside her experimental work.


Welcome also to İsmail who joins the group as a postdoctoral fellow interested in the modelling of spatiotemporal trajectories of structural variation in high grade serous ovarian cancers. We're looking forward to supporting İsmail as he applies his mathematical skills and experience to tumour biology.
