The GOG281/LOGS clinical trial was released today in The Lancet.

The trial demonstrated, for the first time, a new standard of care option for women with progressive or relapsed low-grade serous ovarian cancer. 

Trametinib, currently used to treat skin and lung cancers, was found to slow the progression of low-grade serous ovarian cancer and increase the number of patients who respond to treatment.

We were pleased to contribute to the molecular characterisation of these tumours by processing the sequencing data from their exomes, a small contribution to a much larger team effort led by researchers at the University of Edinburgh and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
