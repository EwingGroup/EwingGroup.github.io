Ailith was pleased to take a week off from changing nappies during her maternity leave to attend the Mark Foundation workshop on chromosomal instability in cancer at Barts Cancer Institute in London.

It was a fantastic meeting full of: big ideas conveyed by flip chart only chalk talks, many useful and interesting discussions, and outstanding kareoke.

Thanks to the organisers Florian Markovetz, Peter van Loo and Sarah McClelland for the invite. 

Watch this space for more CINful activity in the future...
